# ðŸš€ Missile Reentry Phase Classifier

##  Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution for classifying missile flight phases into reentry and non-reentry using telemetry data. It uses an LSTM neural network to process sequential data from missile tracks and follows MLOps best practices for scalable deployment.

### Features
- LSTM-based classification of missile telemetry data
- Dockerized deployment for portability
- Kubernetes configuration for scalability
- RESTful API for real-time predictions
- Logging of inference times and predictions

---

##  Data Description

The model processes telemetry data from missile tracks, including:
- Position coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude)
- Radiometric intensity
- Sensor ID
- Timestamps

---

## Model Architecture

The core of the solution is a multi-layer LSTM network that:
- Handles variable-length telemetry sequences
- Uses dropout (0.3) + batch normalization
- Employs early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Outperforms a baseline altitude threshold classifier
