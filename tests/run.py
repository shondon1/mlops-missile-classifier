    Main entry point for the missile reentry classifier pipeline.
    
    This script orchestrates the end-to-end ML workflow:
    1. Loads and preprocesses telemetry data
    2. Builds and trains an LSTM model for sequence classification
    3. Saves the trained model for deployment
    4. Validates the saved model works as expected
    
    The workflow demonstrates a complete ML pipeline from data to
    validated model ready for production deployment.
